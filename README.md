# Temperature converter

### Description

A simple nodejs project configured with grunt task runner to execute tests using mocha.

### How to run

* Install node js

    "sudo apt-get install node (linux)"
    "brew install node (mac OSX homebrew)"

* Install node.js package manager (brew automatically installs npm along with node)

    "sudo apt-get install npm (linux)"

* Install grunt command line interface

    "npm run grunt-setup"

* Run grunt tasks from the project directory

    "grunt"

P. S. If you are on a linux system and the grunt command does nothing you might wanna run the command "sudo ap-get install nodejs-legacy"
